1) When a task is canceled, and that task is currently blocking... cancel the task it is blocking on as well.  
This could cause interesting things to happen if two tasks are blocking on the same future... one may be canceled,
but not the other... thus, there needs to be a 'block count' to determine how many tasks are blocking on a task
and only cancel the subtask if its block count == 1
